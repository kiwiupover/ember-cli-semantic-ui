    Integration approach

  <div class="ui content">
    The approach taken has been to try to minimize 'magic'.  In most places the
    components use the SemanticUI JavaScript to attach behaviours in an Ember
    compatible way.  For example, when passing options to a component they are
    packaged up and passed 'as is' to the SemanticUI JS functions.

    Another important concept is that the component tags are frequently used
    in block form, so you are able to access all of the normal Handlebars / Ember
    helpers to build your HTML.
