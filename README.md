## Contributions

Contributions for bug fixes are welcome with tests and documentation.  Please reach out to me if you're thinking about adding a feature before sending a pull request.  This reduces the likelihood of doing work that won't be merged. If you're forking for your own project then of course knock yourself out and go crazy!

If you want to make a suggestion, please open an issue on Github.

Whatever happens, remember, **I put this out her for free**, so if you don't like, don't agree or it doesn't work the way you want - please still be polite and constructive.
